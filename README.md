# Socket

My personal Swift Dispatch socket implementation.
This is a playground and **not meant for production implementations**.

### So why bother when better solutions exist

Coz its fun, and a good learning experience.

### I need a socket though

Look at the work IBM is doing with BlueSocket, Kitura-Net and other packages. They use GCD too, its pretty neat.
